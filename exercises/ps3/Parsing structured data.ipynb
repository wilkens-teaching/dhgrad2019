    "# Parsing structured data\n",
    "\n",
    "XML and JSON are formats you'll use often when dealing with textual data. Many texts are encoded in XML or one of its specific flavors, such as TEI. XML is much the older of the two, and by far the more powerful. It has a long history in print and electronic publishing, and is still commonly used in the production of edited texts, complex websites, and certain computational projects. It's a descendant of SGML and a proper superset of HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON, on the other hand, is simpler, lighter weight, newer, and generally easier to compute with. It's the de facto format for data exchange on the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise asks you to ingest, parse, and work with structured data in both XML and JSON formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "### XML\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin with XML, the more difficult of the two. XML looks a lot like HTML, if you've seen that. The main difference is that, where HTML consists of a fixed set of allowable tags, XML tags can be defined arbitrarily according to a spec of the user's choosing. In practice, we won't do much with this, but you'll often find yourself dealing with other projects' arbitrary XML use. For our purposes, all that matters is that you can figure out -- mostly by human examination -- which tags are used to encode what information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of some XML:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n",
    "<TEI xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n",
    "     xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"\n",
    "     xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0 http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/lib/xml/tei/p5/general.xsd\"\n",
    "     xml:id=\"VAC5615\">\n",
    "   <teiHeader>\n",
    "      <fileDesc>\n",
    "         <titleStmt>\n",
    "            <title>Growler's Income Tax </title>\n",
    "            <author>Arthur, T. S. (1809-1885)</author>\n",
    "         </titleStmt>\n",
    "         ...\n",
    "      </fileDesc>\n",
    "   </teiHeader>\n",
    "</TEI>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Exciting, no? This is the beginning of the file you'll use in this exercise. You can see that it begins with information about the XML version and schema used (it's TEI, just so you know). Then there's a header, which contains a title statement, which contains title and author info, etc. This is how XML, HTML, and other structured markup languages work: each element contains one or more others. These are often referred to as parent and child elements. Every child has exactly one parent, but parents many have multiple children and may be children themselves. In the above example,  `<title>` is the child of `<titleStmt>`, which is in turn the child of `<fileDesc>`. `<title>` and `<author>` are siblings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Beautiful Soup\n",
    "\n",
    "Parsing XML in the general case is a pain. You absolutely *do not* want to build a general-purpose XML parser. But you don't need to; other people have done it. One of the most widely used XML parsers for Python is [Beautiful Soup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/). (OK, technically Beautiful Soup is a wrapper for other parsers, but whatever.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Review two sources of information about BeatutifulSoup: The [documentation](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) and a [tutorial](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/intro-to-beautiful-soup) from the Programming Historian. Note that both of these sources cover installation, which is unnecessary if you're using Anaconda (because BeautifulSoup is included therein). Everything you need to know to complete this portion of the exercise is contained in the \"Quick Start\" section of the BS docs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grab a copy of *Growler's Income Tax* by T.S. Arthur in TEI-XML format from the same GitHub directory as this exercise. Save this file in the same directory in which your iPython notebook is saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of things you can do with BeautifulSoup, all of which depend on parsing an XML or HTML document and then searching or modifying the parsed results. In the present case, you'll need to extract four pieces of information from the XML file in question:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The full, library-style author record, in the form \"LastName, FirstName (born-died)\".\n",
    "2. The number of paragraphs in the body of the text.\n",
    "3. The number of words in the body of the text.\n",
    "4. The full, plain-text (no XML tags) content of the embedded epistle.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, you'll need to know how the XML file is structured. Spend some time looking at it, whether in the GitHub display or in a text editor (but probably not Word, which tends to mess with markup). Each piece of information above can be extracted with one line of code, once you've imported and parsed the XML, though you may certainly use more than one line for each if you prefer. You'll use the `find`, `find_all`, and `get_text` methods of BeautifulSoup, plus other things you've learned as necessary. Potential gotcha: BeautifulSoup converts all tag names to lowercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter your code in the cell or cells below. I've given you the code to import BeuatifulSoup and load the XML file, though you may need to change the file name and location to match whatever you've used. Your code should print the four pieces of information listed above."

    "Here we'll use the HathiTrust Research Center's [extracted features dataset](https://analytics.hathitrust.org/datasets), which contains page-level, part-of-speech-tagged word counts from 15.7 million volumes held by the HatiTrust digital library. We'll work with a single book, which happens to be volume 4 of Bret Harte's *Collected Works*.

The JSON loader reads in the JSON data as a multiply nested dictionary of dictionaries, plus a list of dictionaries corresponding to each page in the volume.

    "                            \n",

    "    \n",

    "Here's the algorithm, in English: Use a `for` loop to iterate over the page-level entries, looking for one with key `'seq'` and value `'00000116'` (note that the value is a string, not an integer). If you've found page 116, iterate over the `'tokenPosCount'` dictionary within the `'body'` dictionary for that page. For each token in that dictionary, examine the associated part of speech tag. If it's a noun (that is, the PoS tag is one of `NN`, `NNS`, `NNP`, or `NNPS`), then record the value associated with the PoS key, which is the count of occurrences of that word with that PoS tag on that page. If it's the largest count yet seen, record both the word and the count. When you've finished iterating over the whole volume, print the word and the count.\n",
