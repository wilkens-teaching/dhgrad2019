# Final project

Your final project requires you to write the narrative portion of an application for a level III [NEH Digital Humanities Advancement Grant](https://www.neh.gov/grants/odh/digital-humanities-advancement-grants). This narrative should be no more (nor less) than 10 single-spaced pages and should conform to the [advancement grant guidelines](digital-humanities-advancement-grants-Jan-15-2019.pdf) for the narrative portion of the application.

Begin by reading the guidelines from beginning to end. Pay particular attention to the types of projects that are eligible for funding and the standards by which applications are evaluated. To be clear, you are required to complete and submit **only the narrative portion** of the application.

Your narrative should describe a piece of concrete, practically achievable humanities research that falls under the aegis of the program and that you might like to carry out if you had the requisite time and funding. Your goal is to craft an application narrative that makes the case for the project in convincing terms (as defined in the evaluation criteria). You are free to posit the involvement of other scholars as necessary and appropriate.

You will offer a brief presentation of your proposal for feedback from your colleagues on the last day of class.
