## Summary
A graduate-level introduction to problems and methods in computationally assisted literary studies, with an emphasis on large-scale historical issues. Includes substantial instruction in programming techniques.

## Description

Contemporary criticism has a problem. We long ago gave up the idea that our task was to appreciate and explain a handful of great texts, replacing that goal with a much more important and ambitious one: to understand cultural production -- both today and in centuries past -- as a whole by way of the aesthetic objects it creates. But we have continued to practice our craft as if the methods developed in pursuit of the old project were the only ones suited to the new task. In consequence, we have remained less successful and less persuasive concerning the operations of large-scale cultural production than we would like to be.

This course is devoted to new methods and new objects in cultural and literary studies, specifically those enabled by digital media. It is not, however, a course in media studies. We'll spend most of our time covering both what kinds of criticism are made possible by the availability of digital cultural objects (especially digitized texts), whether those objects are born digital or are post facto electronic surrogates, and how to perform the technical operations necessary to carry out such criticism. The course thus has a substantial technical component, one no more difficult than -- but often quite different from -- most of your existing experience in literary studies. That said, the idea is certainly not to replace the methods you've previously mastered, but to supplement them with new approaches, issues, and questions that will allow you to do better the kinds of cultural and literary criticism you've already begun to practice.

We'll begin with some reflections on the origins of computational literary studies and the rationale for pursuing quantitative work in cultural domains. We'll move quickly to engagements with representative work in the field and to learning how to perform computational analysis. Much of what we read will fall under the broad heading of data mining; we'll study what that term means and how to do it. We'll aim for a mix of theoretical elaborations concerning what is and is not implied by quantitative methods and how those methods integrate with conventional humanities approaches to interpretation, and (the second part of the mix) specific examples of achieved work in the field, plus technical exercises that will help you carry out similar work on your own.

We'll read as widely as possible in both the major works of computational literary studies and in the often-divisive debates about the value of that work. Much of the schedule is set out below, but be aware that this is a rapidly evolving field; we'll adjust our readings in response to new developments that emerge over the course of the semester and to our collective interests or hangups.

Four notes:

1. I'll repeat that this is a course with significant technical components. There's no assumption that you'll enter with any particular computational or mathematical expertise and there will be plenty of help (along with prebuilt tools) available along the way, but you *must* be willing to work outside your presumptive comfort zone as literary critics to develop the skills necessary to conduct the kinds of research we'll explore. This is really exciting stuff and it's not tremendously difficult, but if you shut down early in the face of the command line or a list of numbers, it'll be impossible to do well.

2. Our week-to-week assignments and work will be somewhat different from what you're probably accustomed to. Most notably, there will be -- in addition to the usual books and articles to read -- graded problem sets or other exercises to complete. We'll talk more about the form these will take as the semester progresses.

3. Your final project will also take an unconventional form. You will prepare the narrative portion of a grant application describing a piece of substantial computationally assisted criticism that you would undertake had you world enough, and time. Alternatively, you may work with one or two other students to produce an achieved piece of such scholarship. Details to follow in due course.

4. When we perform our own analyses, we'll work primarily with a set of prepared corpora. This limits in some ways the range of problems we might address, but it helps with the well-known issue that 90% of real-world data-related effort is cleaning up your sources. That said, we can explore other corpora as our needs, desires, and technical abilities dictate.

## Policy statements

### Attendance

One absence, no questions asked. Additional absences will lower your grade.

### Late work

Late work is generally not accepted. If you find yourself in exceptional circumstances, talk to me well in advance of the deadline and we may be able to find an accommodation.

### Collaboration and plagiarism

Talking to other students -- especially those in the course -- about your ideas is a good thing. Taking other people's words, code, or ideas without attribution is plagiarism and will result in honor-code-related unpleasantness. When in doubt, cite. And feel free to ask me about specific cases or problems and about the mechanics of research documentation. For references and guidelines, see the library's [plagiarism](https://libguides.library.nd.edu/friendly.php?s=scholarly-publishing/plagiarism) and [documentation](https://libguides.library.nd.edu/scholarly-publishing/writing-citing) sites and the university's [academic code of honor](https://honorcode.nd.edu/).

Note that the finger exercise on p. 27, which asks you to find the roots of an arbitrary integer by exhaustive enumeration, is poorly constructed in a way that produces a trivial answer (because `x**1 = x`). To avoid this issue, search for roots between 2 and 5 (that is, `1 < pwr < 6`).
